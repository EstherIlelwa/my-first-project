My name is Esther
I'm   a girl
I'm 19 years old, almost 20
I'm learning to love coding though the first day was really not easy:)(ğŸ˜ªğŸ˜«)
I'm an artist, i love art 
My favourite food is pasted fish and rice, the taste never gets old!(ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚)
I really want to become a professional coder! what do you call people that code even!?(ğŸ˜…)
A favorite memroy of mine is when I went on a trip with my family and my twin brother feared to stand by the edge of the cliff for a picture!!! and i kept laughing about it(.):)
After this short course.i'd really like to dive further into coding, like i said, i want to be really good at coding so you guys should just sick back and expect some hot new websites(ğŸ”¥ğŸ”¥)
